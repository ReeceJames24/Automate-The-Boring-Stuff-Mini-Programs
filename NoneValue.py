# all functions have return values, even the print function
# so what exactly does the print function return?
#run this code below to see the difference

'hello' #try typing these two in the interactive shell
print('hello')

#you'll see that simply typing 'hello' will return a 'hello' while typing
#while calling the print('hello') function returns a hello with no quotation marks
#this basically means that the print doesnt return a text string
# simply because print functions return a none value and the showing of the argument is simply a side effect of its function
# note that idle is not designed to show the none value so if you call print() in the interactive shell, you won't get anything in return
